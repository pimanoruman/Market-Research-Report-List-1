<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air & Gas Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Compressors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air and gas compressor market is primarily segmented into two types: positive displacement compressors and centrifugal compressors. Positive displacement compressors operate by trapping a fixed volume of air or gas and reducing its volume to increase pressure; they are ideal for applications requiring high pressure at low flow rates. In contrast, centrifugal compressors use rotational energy to compress gas, making them suitable for high flow rates and lower pressure applications, commonly found in industrial processes and large-scale operations.</p></p>
