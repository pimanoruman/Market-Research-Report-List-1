<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rice Grader Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flatbed</li><li>Cylindrical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rice grader market is categorized into two main types: flatbed and cylindrical. Flatbed graders feature a horizontal platform where rice is uniformly spread, allowing for precise separation based on size and weight. They are often ideal for larger operations with high throughput needs. In contrast, cylindrical graders employ a rotating cylindrical design that effectively separates rice grains by size as they pass through. This type is compact and efficient, particularly suitable for smaller facilities or specific grading requirements.</p></p>
