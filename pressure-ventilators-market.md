<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Postive Pressure</li><li>Negative Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pressure ventilators market is divided into two main types: positive pressure ventilators and negative pressure ventilators. Positive pressure ventilators deliver air into the lungs, aiding patients with respiratory issues, and are commonly used in settings like hospitals for critical care. In contrast, negative pressure ventilators create a vacuum effect around the chest, facilitating breathing by expanding the lungs; these are often used in home care settings for conditions like neuromuscular disorders. Both types play crucial roles in respiratory support.</p></p>
