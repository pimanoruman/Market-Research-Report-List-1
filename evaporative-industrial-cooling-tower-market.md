<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Industrial Cooling Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cooling Tower</li><li>Closed Cooling Tower</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The evaporative industrial cooling tower market consists of two main types: open cooling towers and closed cooling towers. Open cooling towers use ambient air to cool water, which is then circulated back through industrial processes, making them efficient but susceptible to contamination and evaporation losses. Closed cooling towers, on the other hand, utilize a closed loop system that separates process water from the environment, reducing water loss and contamination risks while also providing efficient cooling for sensitive applications.</p></p>
